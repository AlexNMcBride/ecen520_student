# Glitches in Finite State Machines

Glitches are a common problem in digital design. 
They are caused by the propagation delay of signals through combinational logic. 
In this lecture, we will discuss how glitches can occur in finite state machines (FSMs) and how to avoid them.

## Reading
  * Chapter 10 sections 6-8 from [RTL Hardware Design Using VHDL](http://search.lib.byu.edu/byu/record/sfx.3578786?holding=i9vahb2m4z7qvbf3) book (ignore the VHDL code examples for now). Download the pdf from this textbook as you will use it later in the semester.
    * 10.6: State assignment. This should be review.
    * 10.7: Moore output buffering. This is a new topic. Make sure you read and understand this carefully including the "Look ahead" circuit.
    * 10.8: These are examples you can browse through but it is VHDL so you can probably ignore it.

## Key Concepts
  * FSM Encoding approaches
  * The difference between "Moore" and "Mealy" outputs
  * Moore output buffering and inability to implement Mealy output buffering
  * FSM Output glitches
